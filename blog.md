# Chance’s Spring 2021 Awesome Inc Bootcamp Blog
## Week 1
### 1/29/21
1. ***Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?***<br>
My first week was not what I expected. I expected us to start coding first. However, I’m glad we are going over the general workflow of software development first because I believe Git can be a big barrier of entry to software development. I also expected Git to come more naturally because I have worked with it before.
2. ***What are you struggling with?***<br>
I’m struggling to understand the proper workflow to use when using Git from the terminal and GitHub together.
3. ***What are you excited or eager to learn more about?***<br>
I’m excited to fully understand GitHub because I can see how it can be very useful when making changes to a repository, when viewing the history of a repository, and during collaborative development.
## Week 2
### 2/5/21
1. ***What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?***<br>
Pseudo coding can be very useful when getting started on a project because you can turn the project into a set of simplified instructions, making the project less intimidating. Furthermore, pseudocode is just notes, so you can refer to your pseudocode in the future.
2. ***What are you struggling with?***<br>
I'm struggling to add creativity to my assignments. I'm concerned with getting my assignments finished, but I'm not concerned with adding any creative flair to my work after it has been finished. However, I do enjoy what we are learning, and I am excited to keep learning:)
3. ***What are you excited or eager to learn more about?***<br>
I'm excited to start using GitHub collaboratively. I'm eager to offer solutions in the form of pull requests to others on GitHub and I'm eager to accept or reject pull requests from others for my own repositories.
