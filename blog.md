# Chance’s Spring 2021 Awesome Inc Bootcamp Blog
## Week 1
### 1/29/21
1. *Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?*
My first week was not what I expected. I expected us to start coding first. However, I’m glad we are going over the general workflow of software development first because I believe Git can be a big barrier of entry to software development. I also expected Git to come more naturally because I have worked with it before.
2. *What are you struggling with?*
I’m struggling to understand the proper workflow to use when using Git from the terminal and GitHub together.
3. *What are you excited or eager to learn more about?*
I’m excited to fully understand GitHub because I can see how it can be very useful when making changes to a repository, when viewing the history of a repository, and during collaborative development.
