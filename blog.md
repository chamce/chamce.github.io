# Chance’s Spring 2021 Awesome Inc Bootcamp Blog
## Week 1
### 1/29/21
1. My first week was not what I expected. I expected us to start coding first. However, I’m glad we are going over the general workflow of software development first because I believe Git can be a big barrier of entry to software development. I also expected Git to come more naturally because I have worked with it before.
2. I’m struggling to understand the proper workflow to use when using Git from the terminal and GitHub together.
3. I’m excited to fully understand GitHub because I can see how it can be very useful when making changes to a repository, when viewing the history of a repository, and during collaborative development.
